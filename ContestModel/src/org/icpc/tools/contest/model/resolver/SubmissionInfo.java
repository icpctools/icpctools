/**
 * This class encapsulates the concept of a single SubmissionInfo operation; that is, for a given
 * Team and Problem, for each of the pending submission the team has on the problem, what will be
 * the standing of the team if the resolution of the pending submission is Yes; what will be the
 * team's best possible standing if they get a Yes on ALL their pending problems and all other
 * teams get a No; and what will be the team's worst possible standing if they get a No on all
 * their pending problems and all other teams get a Yes on theirs.
 *
 * The class does not actually calculate any of this data; it simple acts as a holder for it. The
 * actual calculations are done in {@link Resolver.projectStandings(SubmissionInfo)}, which accepts
 * a SubmissionInfo object and fills it in with the solved, best-case, and worst-case data.
