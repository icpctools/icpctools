An ICPC Tool

== Introduction
The ICPC Presentation System provides a mechanism for generating "slide show" presentations containing
user-provided images, photos, and a variety of live data from a running contest.  
The Presentation System consists of two components: _Presentation Clients_ and the _Presentation Admin_.
This document describes the Presentation Client component;
refer to the separate documentation on the Presentation Admin for an explanation of how that component operates.

A Presentation Client is a single process which displays (rotates between) one or more _presentations_.
The Presentation System contains a wide variety of built-in presentations, each of which is identified 
by having both a _number_ and a _title_ (also referred to as its _name_).  
Each presentation client is started by giving it a list of the
presentations (by number or title) that the client should display.  It is allowable to start multiple
simultaneous presentation clients, each displaying its own (possibly overlapping) set of presentations.
Each separate presentation client is typically run on a separate machine, with each machine connected 
to a projector or large display to allow many people to watch. (At the ICPC World Finals, for example,
as many as 10 or more separate screens are displayed, each running its own specified sequence of presentations.)

Some built-in presentations incorporate data from a running contest.  For example, one presentation
knows how to display the current contest scoreboard, updating it as the contest progresses;
another displays a rising (animated) balloon, labeled with the appropriate team and problem letter/color,
whenever a team solves a problem; 
another presentation shows a graph of the languages used to solve problems so far in the contest; 
another shows the runs currently in the "judge's queue" and the judgment each runs receives
as it exits the queue;
still another presentation shows the current contest clock (remaining time); 
and so forth.

The following images show some of the many built-in presentations which can be displayed by the
Presentation System; see below for a complete list of available presentations.

== Input Data Sources

When a Presentation Client is started it must be told, in addition to what presentations to display,
where to obtain its input data (images, contest events, etc.).
This is referred to as specifying a _contest data source_.  
Presentation Clients can obtain their input data from three different types of contest data sources: 
a https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php/Main_Page#Contest_Data_Package[_contest data package (CDP)_],
a https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php/Contest_Control_System[_contest control system (CCS)_], 
or a https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php/CDS[_contest data server (CDS)_].
(A _Contest Data Server_ is another ICPC Tool; see the 
http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpctools[ICPC Tools website] for details.)

When connecting to a live Contest Control System, the Presentation Client works by reading 
the _event feed_ output of the CCS
The ICPC Presentation System will work with any CCS that produces an event feed which is 
compliant with the https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/[_CLI CCS Specification_].  
Systems known to produce compliant event feeds include 
http://pc2.ecs.csus.edu[PC-Squared] and 
https://www.kattis.com/[Kattis]; 
other Contest Control Systems may also produce compatible event feeds and 
hence work with the Presentation System.

A second way to provide the Presentation Client with input data is by creating a _contest data package_ (CDP). 
A CDP is an arbitrarily-named folder with specific contest-configuration contents;
see the above reference for details on CDP structure.     

Alternatively, a Presentation Client can obtain its input from a Contest Data Server. 
A CDS provides URL access points for obtaining event feed and other contest data; 
starting a Presentation Client with the URL of a CDS causes it to connect to the CDS 
and pull down the necessary information dynamically.  
(Note: the CDS must have been configured to connect to a compatible CCS in order
for it to supply event feed data to the Presentation Client.)

== Using the Presentation Client

=== Installation

To install the Presentation Client, download and unzip the Presentation Client 
distribution package to any convenient location. 
The Presentation Client itself is a collection of Java programs (components).
The distribution is a self-contained package which contains 
all the Java libraries and other components necessary to run the Presentation Client.
(Note however that Java itself, version 1.8 or higher, must be installed on the
machine.)

=== Operation

The Presentation Client is designed to run in one of two modes:  _standalone_ 
or _admin_controlled_.  This document focuses on using the Presentation Client
in _standalone_ mode.  Using the Presentation Client in _admin-controlled_ mode
requires installing the separate _Presentation Admin_ ICPC Tool; that usage
is discussed briefly below and is described in greater detail in the separate 
documentation for the Presentation Admin (a separate ICPC Tool).

==== Standalone Mode

The Presentation Client distribution includes a script (batch file) 
named _standalone.bat_ which can be used
to execute the Presentation Client in standalone mode in a Windows environment.
(It would be easy to develop an equivalent script for Linux or similar systems;
however, see _Additional Notes_, below.)
Also, see the Presentation Admin documentation for information regarding a
second script, _client.bat_, which is contained in the Presentation Client
distribution.

The _standalone.bat_ script assumes it is being run from the main 
Presentation Client folder (i.e., from the folder where the distribution was unzipped).
The script is intended to be invoked with a set of command line parameters,
which it forwards to the Presentation Client program and which 
control the operation of the program.  

The first parameter to script must be a set of presentation names or numbers, 
separated by "|"; for example, "2|4|clock" (which requests a presentation sequence
consisting of presentation number 2, then number 4, then the presentation named "clock").
Note that the vertical bar character ("|") is significant to many shell programs
(command prompts); therefore, Presentation Client arguments containing this character
must typically be surrounded by double-quotes.

The second parameter to the script specifies a contest data source.
If the second parameter is the name of a folder,
the Presentation Client interprets it as the root of a _contest data package (CDP)_,
as described above, and it uses the specified CDP to obtain its contest data.
  
If the second parameter is the keyword "ccs"
the Presentation Client expects the next two parameters to
specify a host and port, and it attempts to open a connection to an event feed 
from a Contest Control System at that host and port.

If the second parameter is a URL, the Presentation Client interprets it as
the URL of a contest data server; it opens a connection to the specified
CDS and reads its input data from the CDS.  When the second parameter specifies 
an HTTPS URL, the Presentation Client expects the next two parameters to
specify a user name and password.  This user name and password is used to login to 
a CDS at the specified URL.
 
To terminate a running presentation, press Ctrl-Q.

==== Admin-Control Mode

As described above, the Presentation Client provides support for displaying
(rotating between) one or more individual presentations.  Each instance of the Presentation
Client is limited to this functionality; multiple instances can be started but
they have no knowledge of each other, there is no way to coordinate their
content other than manually when they are started, and there is no way to change
the content of a given Presentation Client except by shutting it down and restarting it.

The ICPC Tool set also includes a separate tool called the _Presentation Admin_
(see the http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpctools[ICPC Tool website]). 
The Presentation Admin tool provides functionality
for managing multiple Presentation Clients; it allows dynamically changing the content
of each of many clients along with additional related functions.

If a Presentation Client is going to be used in conjunction with a Presentation Admin,
the Presentation Client must be started in a slightly different way.  This is supported
by a second script (batch file) named _client.bat_.  

Like the _standalone.bat_ script, the _client.bat_ script assumes it is being run from the main 
Presentation Client folder (i.e., from the folder where the Presentation *Client*
distribution was unzipped),
and the script is intended to be invoked with a set of command line parameters
which control the operation of the Presentation Client program.  
In this case, however, the parameters
are used to tell the Presentation Client that it is to register itself with
a Presentation Admin and to await further instructions from the Admin.

The first parameter to the client.bat script is a client-specific identifier
(typically a number) specifying the identity of the client being started
(this ID value is used to uniquely identify this particular Presentation Client
to the Presentation Admin).  The second script parameter must be the URL of
a Contest Data Server to which the client should connect and from which it
will receive Admin commands (the Presentation Admin will connect to the
same CDS and issue commands to it which the CDS forwards to designated
Presentation Clients).  The third and fourth parameters to the client.bat script
are the login user name and password for the CDS.


== Usage

The general form for executing the Presentation Client in standalone mode is

[source]
  standalone.bat/sh  <presentationList> <contestSource> [options]
  
where
........
  <presentationList> is one or more presentation names or ids, separated by |
  
  <contestSource> is either an HTTP URL to connect to a CDS
                  or an HTTPS URL to a CDS, followed by user and password
                  or "ccs" to connect to a CCS, followed by host and port
                  or [folder] to load from a contest data package archive folder

  [options] can be "--display <num>", where <num> is which desktop display to use
                  in full-screen exclusive mode. The primary display is number 1,
                  secondary is number 2, etc. If this option is not specified
                  the default is the primary display.
........

The general form for executing the Presentation Client in admin-controlled mode is

[source]
  client.bat/sh id CDSurl user password

where
.......
  id is an arbitrary name used to identify this client
  CDSurl is an HTTPS CDS URL
  user and password are your HTTPS credentials
.......

== Examples

[source]
  standalone.bat "logo|pictures" https://cds user pwd
  
The above command starts the Presentation Client, causes it to connect to a CDS at the specified
URL using the specified user name ("user") and password ("pwd"), and begins alternating between
two presentation displays: the first consisting of the ICPC Contest Logo, the second
consisting of a set of pictures obtained from the appropriate CDS URL.

[source]
  standalone.sh scoreboard ccs ccsServer 4713 --display 2
  
The above command starts the Presentation Client, causes it to connect to a live
Contest Control System on the host named "ccsServer" at port 4713, and begins
displaying the "scoreboard" presentation, updating as information comes in from 
the live CCS connection. The presentation is shown on the secondary display.
  
[source]
  standalone.bat "1|3|16" c:\myContestCDP

The above command starts the Presentation Client, causes it to load contest information
from the Contest Data Package whose root is the folder "c:\\myContestCDP", and begins
alternating between presentations 1, 3, and 16.
  
[source]
  client.sh Client1 https://contestDataServer user pwd

The above command starts a Presentation Client in admin-controlled mode, causing it
to connect to the CDS specified by the URL _https://contestDataServer_ logging in 
with the name "user" and the password "pwd" and registering itself with the Presentation
Admin as "Client1".  The Presentation Client then remains
quiescent with a blank screen until it receives a command from a Presentation Admin
(forwarded via the CDS) telling it what to display.

== Available Presentations

The Presentation System contains a variety of built-in presentations which can be
displayed by Presentation Clients.
(It is also possible for users to create their own presentations, both static
and dynamic, and to include them into the ICPC Presentation System; a future version 
of this document will provide information on how that works.)
Some of the available presentations are listed in the table below, which shows
their identifying number and name, the internal specification by which they are known,
and notes on their operation.  (Note that some presentations are only useful when used
in conjunction with the Presentation Admin.)

|==========================

== Additional Notes

The Presentation System is written in Java and will run on any platform supporting Java Version 7 or greater.  
However, it makes heavy use of screen-level graphics and is therefore heavily dependent on the 
graphics drivers on the platform.  
In our experience, Linux graphics drivers tend to be substantially less robust than others; 
we have had much better success running the Presentation components 
on Windows platforms.
Your mileage may vary (substantially).
