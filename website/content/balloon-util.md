The ICPC Balloon Utility (BU) is a tool for keeping track of balloons earned by contest teams
for successful run submissions.  It receives submission information from one of several
input sources, displays information about each submission (such as the problem, team,
run ID, school, submission time, etc.) and optionally automatically prints "balloon
notification" messages to assist runners in delivering balloons.  It also provides
runners with an interactive mechanism for tracking delivered balloons, and is even
capable of printing maps showing runners where to go find the appropriate balloon
and where on the contest floor the receiving team is located (although instructions
for configuring it to do that are beyond the scope of this introductory guide).
