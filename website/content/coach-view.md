The Coach View is a software component designed to provide the ability for spectators
(coaches as well as other interested people) to view either or both of a selected team's desktop (machine screen)
or web camera during a contest.  It requires that the Contest Administrator configure desktop
and/or webcam streaming from team machines during the contest, and also requires a
[Contest API](https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php/Contest_API) source that implements video streaming, for
example the ICPC Tools [Contest Data Server](/cds).

The Coach View provides the ability for a coach to select a specific team by name or team number and to view
either or both of that team's desktop and webcam video feeds.
